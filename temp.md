❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() {
return a + b;
}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope, meaning the function will rely on variables from its
surrounding scope. This is problematic because:

* It introduces implicit dependencies, making the function's behavior unpredictable and hard to reason about. The
function's output depends on where and how it's called.
* If `a` or `b` are not defined in the surrounding scope, it will result in a `ReferenceError` in strict mode or `NaN`
in non-strict mode.
* It makes the function less reusable and harder to test in isolation.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ The function now explicitly declares `a` and `b` as parameters.
* ✔️ The function becomes self-contained, predictable, and reusable.
* ✔️ Avoids potential `ReferenceError` or unexpected results.

Additional Considerations:

* ✔️ Consider adding input validation/type checking to ensure `a` and `b` are numbers for robust code.
* ✔️ Add JSDoc style comments to describe what the function does, and the type of parameters it takes.
